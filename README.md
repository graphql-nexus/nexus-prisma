# nexus-prisma

[![trunk](https://github.com/prisma/nexus-prisma/actions/workflows/trunk.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/prisma/nexus-prisma/actions/workflows/trunk.yml)

Official Prisma plugin for Nexus.  
**Currently in development - not to be used in Production.** Follow the progress from [here](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-plugin-prisma/issues/1039).

## Installation

```
npm add nexus-prisma graphql @prisma/client
npm add --dev prisma
```

> `graphql` and `@prisma/client` are peer dependencies. `prisma` is for the Prisma CLI which you'll probably want during development.

## Example

```prisma

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

generator nexusPrisma {
  // This is a temporary name, soon will be just "nexus-prisma" (pending a change in Prisma core).
  provider = "nexus-prisma-2"
}


/// This is a user!
model User {
  /// This is an id!
  id  String  @id
}
```

```
$ prisma generate
```

```ts
import { User } from 'nexus-prisma'
import { makeSchema, objectType } from 'nexus'

export const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [
    objectType({
      name: User.$name
      description: User.$description
      definition(t) {
        t.field(User.id.name, User.id)
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

## Features

> **Note**: â›‘ The following use abbreviated examples that skip a complete setup of passing Nexus type definition to Nexus `makeSchema`. If you are new to Nexus, Consider reading the [official Nexus tutorial](https://nxs.li/tutorial) before jumping into Nexus Prisma.

### Type-safe seamless generated library code

Following the same philosophy as Prisma Client, Nexus Prisma uses generation to create an API that feels tailor made for your project.

```prisma
model User {
  id  String  @id
}
```

```ts
import { User } from 'nexus-prisma'
import { objectType } from 'nexus'

objectType({
  name: User.$name
  description: User.$description
  definition(t) {
    t.field(User.id.name, {
      type: User.id.type,
      description: User.id.description
    })
  }
})
```

### Custom GraphQL Scalars for Native Prisma Scalars

Prisma has a few native scalar types that are not supported by any native GraphQL scalar type.

When Nexus Prisma sees a Prisma field whose type is one of these scalars, it does nothing special. It just generates them as GraphQL type references like any other.

Nexus Prisma does not allow to directly map these Prisma scalars to GraphQL scalar `String`. Instead you should define the necessary custom scalars in your GraphQL API.

You can define the necessary custom scalars manually, or use the pre-prepared Nexus scalar type definitions from Nexus Prisma.

Example: Use the pre-prepared scalar type definitions from Nexus Prisma:

```ts
import * as customScalars from 'nexus-prisma/scalars'
import { makeSchema } from 'nexus'

makeSchema({
  types: [customScalars],
})
```

Example: Use custom Nexus scalar type definitions:

```ts
import { GraphQLScalarType } from 'graphql'
import { JSONObjectResolver, DateTimeResolver } from 'graphql-scalars'
import { asNexusMethod, makeSchema } from 'nexus'

const jsonScalar = new GraphQLScalarType({
  ...JSONObjectResolver,
  // Override the default 'JsonObject' name with one that matches what Nexus Prisma expects.
  name: 'Json',
})

const dateTimeScalar = new GraphQLScalarType(DateTimeResolver)

makeSchema({
  types: [asNexusMethod(jsonScalar, 'json'), asNexusMethod(dateTimeScalar, 'dateTime')],
})
```

### Prisma ID field to GraphQL ID scalar type mapping

All `@id` fields in your Prisma Schema get projected as `ID` types, not `String` types.

```prisma
model User {
  id  String  @id
}
```

```ts
import { User } from 'nexus-prisma'
import { objectType } from 'nexus'

objectType({
  name: User.$name
  description: User.$description
  definition(t) {
    t.field(User.id.name, User.id)
  }
})
```

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID
}
```

### Prisma Schema model & field documentation re-use

#### GraphQL documentation for your API clients

```prisma
/// A user.
model User {
  /// A stable identifier to find users by.
  id  String  @id
}
```

```ts
import { User } from 'nexus-prisma'
import { objectType } from 'nexus'

User.$description // JSDoc: A user.
User.id.description // JSDoc: A stable identifier to find users by.

objectType({
  name: User.$name
  description: User.$description
  definition(t) {
    t.field(User.id.name, User.id)
  }
})
```

```graphql
"""
A user.
"""
type User {
  """
  A stable identifier to find users by.
  """
  id: ID
}
```

#### Internal JSDoc for your team

```prisma
/// A user.
model User {
  /// A stable identifier to find users by.
  id  String  @id
}
```

```ts
import { User } from 'nexus-prisma'

User // JSDoc: A user.
User.id // JSDoc: A stable identifier to find users by.
```

### Refined DX

These are finer points that aren't perhaps worth a top-level point but none the less add up toward a thoughtful developer experience.

##### Default JSDoc Prompts

Fields and models that you do not document will result in a helpful default JSDoc that teaches you about this.

##### Runtime Proxy

When your project is in a state where the generated Nexus Prisma part is missing (new repo clone, reinstalled deps, etc.) Nexus Prisma gives you a default runtime export named `PleaseRunPrismaGenerate` and will error with a clear message.

##### Opt-outable friendly runtime peer dependency checks

When `nexus-prisma` is imported it will validate that your project has peer dependencies setup correctly.

If a peer dependenvy is not installed it `nexus-prisma` will log an error and then exit 1. If its version does not satify the range supported by the current version of `nexus-prisma` that you have installed, then a warning will be logged. If you want to opt-out of this validation then set an envar as follows:

```
NO_PEER_DEPENDENCY_CHECK=true|1
PEER_DEPENDENCY_CHECK=false|0
```

## Notes

- Versions of `nexus-prisma` package prior to `0.20` were a completely different version of the API, and had also become deprecated at one point to migrate to `nexus-plugi-prisma` when Nexus Framework was being worked on. All of that is history.
