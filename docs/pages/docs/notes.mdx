description: This plugin integrates Prisma into Nexus. It gives you an API you to project fields from models defined in your Prisma schema into your GraphQL API. It also gives you an API to build GraphQL root fields that allow your API clients to query and mutate data.

# Notes

## Which should I use? `nexus-plugin-prisma` vs `nexus-prisma` vs Vanilla Nexus

### Vanilla Nexus

[npm](https://npmjs.org/nexus) | [github](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus)

If stability is the most important thing for you then Prisma+Nexus vanilla is probably good for you.

- pro: flexible
- pro: stable
- con: If you have a lot of boilerplate CRUD then might feel painful

### `nexus-plugin-prisma`

[npm](https://npmjs.org/nexus-plugin-prisma) | [github](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-plugin-prisma)

If automatic CRUD is the most important thing for you then maybe stick with the old nexus-prisma.

- pro: rich automated CRUD featureset
- con: not flexible
- con: not being actively maintained
- con: not kept up to date with Prisma
- con: buggy

### `nexus-prisma`

[npm](http://npmjs.org/nexus-prisma) | [github](https://github.com/prisma/nexus-prisma)

If you would benefit from model projection features and are ok with using early access software then consider `nexus-prisma`.

- pro: flexible
- pro: maintained
- con: early access, things may change, bugs may be present, features may be incomplete.

## Working with Bundlers

### Disable Peer Dependency Check

When working with bundlers, it probably makes sense to disable the runtime peer dependency check system since the bundle step is merging the dependency tree into a single file and may be moved to run standalone away from the original project manifest (e.g. in a docker container).

Instructions to do this can be found [here](/features#peer-dependency-validation).

### General Support

`nexus-prisma` has tests showing that it supports `ncc`. Other bundlers are not tested and may or may not work. It is our goal however that nexus-prisma not be the reason for any popular bundler to not work on your project. So if you encounter a problem with one (e.g. `parcel`), open an issue here and we'll fix the issue including an addition to our test suite.

## For users of `nexus-prisma@=<0.20`

Versions of `nexus-prisma` package prior to `0.20` were a completely different version of the API, and had also become deprecated at one point to migrate to `nexus-plugin-prisma` when Nexus Framework was being worked on. All of that is history.

## For users of `nexus@=<1.0`

The [release of Nexus 1.1](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/releases/tag/1.0.0) introduced an overload to `t.field` allowing improved usage of Nexus Prisma. The difference is as follows. Note if you prefer the older way that is and always will be supported too.

```diff ts
import { User } from 'nexus-prisma'
import { makeSchema, objectType } from 'nexus'

export const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [
    objectType({
      name: User.$name
      description: User.$description
      definition(t) {
+        t.field(User.id) //                 <-- for nexus@>=1.1 users
-        t.field(User.id.name, User.id) //   <-- For nexus@=<1.0 users
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

## Supported Versions Of Node

We only officially support what we test.

We test Node versions that are `Active LTS` and `Current`. For which versions of Node that equals you can refer to our tests or look here: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases.

## Supported Versions Of `@prisma/client`

We only officially support what we test.

We are testing Prisma Client versions `^5.0` but locked to the recent version, which has passed tests. If there is a newer release of prisma dependencies than the locked version, but it failed, we are still upgrading other dependencies and testing given changes against the locked version.

## Supported Versions Of `ts-node`

We only officially support what we test.

We test `ts-node` versions `10.x`.

Reminder: `ts-node` is an optional peer dep required when you are working with the [gentime settings](https://pris.ly/nexus-prisma/docs/settings/gentime).

### Matrix Testing Policy

We test the latest versions of `@prisma/client` against `Active LTS` and `Current` Node on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows while past versions of `@prisma/client` are tested only against `Current` Node on Ubuntu. We do this to keep the CI test matris reasonable as the number of past `@prisma/client` versions supported could grow long.

### Patch Version Support Policy

We only support the latest patch version of a minor series. For example imagine that there was a bug when `nexus-prisma` was integrated with `@prisma/client@2.30.1` but _not_ when integrated with `@prisma/client@2.30.2`. Our policy would be that users should upgrade to the latest `2.30.x` version, and that we would not release any no code changes of `nexus-prisma`.

### ESM Support

We are not supporting esm build yet, more info [here](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-prisma/discussions/693).
